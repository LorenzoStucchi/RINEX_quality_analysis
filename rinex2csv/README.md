# RINEX2CSV

A script to transform the RINEX into a pandas dataframe and after into a CSV. This process is done to improve the reading time need for further analysis.

For reading a 1 hour RINEX at least 30 minutes could be required.

It is suggested to launch the rinex2csv.py script from the terminal with the command:

```
python3 rinex2csv.py
```
